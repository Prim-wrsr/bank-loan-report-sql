# 🏦 Bank Loan Report (SQL + Tableau)  
This project analyzes a bank's loan performance to monitor lending activity, track repayments, and evaluate borrower risk using Microsoft SQL Server and Tableau Public.

## 📌 Project Overview  
The goal was to monitor key loan metrics (like funded amount, total received, and interest rates), compare good vs. bad loans, and uncover borrower behavior patterns using visual dashboards. Insights help the bank make data-driven lending decisions and identify risk areas.

## 🧰 Tools Used  
- Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)  
- Tableau Public  

## 📊 Key SQL Queries  
- MTD & MoM KPIs (Funded Amount, Payments Received, etc.)  
- Loan Performance by Status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current)  
- Loan Breakdown by Term, Purpose, Employment Length, and Home Ownership  
- Regional Lending Activity (State-wise analysis)  
- Loan Grade Analysis (A to G)
